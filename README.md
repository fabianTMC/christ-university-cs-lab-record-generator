# Lab Report Generator
This macro is written for the students of the department of Computer Science, Christ University. It will automatically generate the lab report document for you when you provide the source code and screenshots.

## Usage
* Create a new folder. For the folder structure, you can refer to the `demo` folder.
* Inside the new folder, paste all the source code files in alphabetical order in which you want them to be inserted into the report.
    * For example:
        ```
        01.sh
        02.sh
        03.sh
        ```
        or
        ```
        abc.sh
        png.sh
        zzz.sh
        ```
* After this, create a new folder inside the folder created called `screenshots`
* Only .png screenshots are supported as of now.
* Paste all your screenshots in this folder and name them the same as that of the code whose output it is.
    * For example:
        ```
        01.sh.png
        02.sh.png
        03.sh.png
        ```
        or
        ```
        abc.sh.png
        png.sh.png
        zzz.sh.png
        ```
* **Important Note:** 
    > Make sure that should use 01 and not 1 in your file names as the sorting algorthim used by Microsoft Word will sort in the order of 1, 10, 11, 2 and not 1,2,10,11.
* Once this is done, open the `lab record macro.docm` file.
* Click Enable Macros.
* Click `View->Macros`
* Select `Macro2` and click `Run`.
* In the dialog box that appears, select the folder you created and click OK. The process will take a few minutes.

# Generating the correct Table of Contents
* Once the report is generated, you will need to correct the program descriptions and dates by running a `Search & Replace` for:
    * The file names and replace them with the program description.
    * The date file names and replace them with the date.
    * Page numbers have to be inserted manually.
* **NOTE:** You can use each cell in the generated TOC to perform the search and replace as they are unique values.
* Once this process is done, move the table of contents to `Lab_Record_Format_2015.doc` file.
